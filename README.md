## 🛠 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning – Power Query Editor

* Imported the CSV file into Power BI
* Removed unnecessary columns and simplified free-text responses
* Standardized job titles and programming languages

**Key Takeaway:** Real-world text data requires cleanup before it can be analyzed effectively.

---

### 2️⃣ Salary Transformation & Calculations

* Split and cleaned salary range text (e.g., “106k–125k”)
* Calculated numeric average salary values

**Key Takeaway:** Converting text ranges to numeric metrics enables meaningful analysis.

---

### 3️⃣ Dashboard Building – Report View

* Created KPI cards for totals and averages
* Built bar, column, gauge, and donut charts
* Set up interactive filters (e.g., country-based filtering)

**Key Takeaway:** Visualizations make insights easy to interpret and explore.
